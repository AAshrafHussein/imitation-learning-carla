# imitation-learning-carla



training imitation learning (neural network) autonomous driving agent on depth data generated by Carla simulator 



## Fast start:

### Installation
  - clone carla simulator binaries (version 0.8.4) from [here](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/tree/0.8.4).
  - add race track files following this repo.
  - build carla follwing this [steps](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/0.8.4/how_to_build_on_linux/) (note ist's only tested in linux).
  - copy racetrack folder to the follwong path in carla enironment *"/PythonClient/racetrack"*.
  
*note that you **can't use pre build carla distriputions** as they don't contain the racetrack maps, and we need them for this project, imintation learning with depth can't train on town maps found on carla.

 **now you ready to run scripts to record data and train the network.**
 


### recording data
all the follwong command run form main carla directory.
1- start calra sirver by running this command:
```sh
$ ./CarlaUE4.sh /Game/Maps/Racetrack -windowed -carla-server -quality-level=Epic -benchmark -fps=20 
```
you are free to change the parameters *-quality-level* to Low or remove bothe *-benchmark -fps=20* to make the simulation time step is a real-time time step. 

2- open a **new terminal** -leave the first one running- and run this command to start generating data:
```sh
$ python ./PythonClient/racetrack/client_control.py -q Low -rep mpc_rt01 -e 1 -s 45 --controller_name mpc --racetrack 01
```

### training the neural network
```sh
$ python ./PythonClient/racetrack/train_on_depth.py
```
to be done will be done later...
